 *   - temp >= 25 and no rain  → "Great weather for hiking - don't forget sunscreen"
 *   - temp >= 25 and raining  → "Warm but rainy - consider indoor activities"
 *   - temp >= 15 and no rain  → "Perfect hiking weather - enjoy the trails"
 *   - temp >= 15 and raining  → "Cool and rainy - bring waterproof gear if hiking"
 *   - temp >= 5 and no rain   → "Chilly - wear layers for your hike"
 *   - temp >= 5 and raining   → "Cold and wet - best to stay indoors"
 *   - temp < 5                → "Too cold - stay warm indoors"
 *
 * @param {number} temperature - Temperature in Celsius
 * @param {boolean} isRaining - Whether it's currently raining
